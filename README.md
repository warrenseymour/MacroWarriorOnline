==================

Hotkey macros to improve MechWarrior Online in-game chat.

This is an AHK script that displays a handy menu of Team-chat and All-chat messages. The aim to communicate a bit more effectively in PUG games without spending the whole time typing.

I haven't added any kind of in-game overlay yet, nor do I know if it's possible with AHK and MWO. You may need to keep the window open in sight on a secondary monitor for it to be of any use to you.


Usage
=====

This script has not been compiled, so you'll need to have AHK installed. Also, you may have to run this script with Administrator permissions to ensure that your keypresses are captured ingame.

Press F1 to see the list of predefined Team-chat messages. Press F2 to see the list of predefined All-chat messages. Press 1 - 9 to send the appropriate message.

Messages ending in {Enter} will send the message automatically. Messages ending in {Space} will keep the chat box open so that you may add additional information, such as a grid reference.

Feel free to edit the script and change the predefined messages in team1-9 and all1-9.

I hope you find this tool as useful as I do. Feedback and pull requests are most welcome.
